# Dessert_Recipe_App
## iOS App that lets users select and view all sorts of dessert recipes

Built on Swift Playgrounds.

### There are 2 main files

1. MyApp.SWIFT - main
2. RecipeListView.SWIFT - contains all the code

### APIs Used:

1. https://themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?c=Dessert 

RecipeListView.SWIFT calls an API that ```GETs``` all the dessert names.

2. https://themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/lookup.php?i=MEAL_ID

RecipeListView.SWIFT calls an API that ```GETs``` a dessert's recipe when the recipe_id is sent as input.

### There is also a video called App_video where you can view how the app works.
